<h1>The Fate of Humanity</h1>

<p><i>
Beings are observing humans on Earth. They admire the good aspects of humanity but they notice the endless wars, poverty, inequality, 
environmental destruction etc. They are in dialogue about whether or not they should use their advanced capabilities to impose a 
fair and sustainable civilisation on Earth.</i><p>

<p>
  <b>Justice</b>: Don’t be ridiculous! Of course we need to save them. There are billions of life forms on that planet, with all their fates tied to one.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Wisdom</b>: Do you not remember when you yourself looked to the stars for salvation? It took eons for you to turn your own eyes away. What were you hoping for?
</p>

<p>
  <b>Justice</b>:  For beings like us.  That is exactly my point - no one ever came for me, but I am in a position ...
  </p>
  
<p>
  <b>Time</b>: You’ve forgotten that I’ve been here since the beginning. I was watching all along. It was quite a predicament actually, solving the problem of evil.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Justice</b>: Are you saying you could have saved us but you chose not to?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Time</b>: It was not for me to choose.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Justice</b>:  What? Preposterous!
</p>
<p>
  <b>Wisdom</b>: Perhaps what our old friend means is that he gave us the opportunity to save ourselves? Correct me if I am wrong, but I’m sure you don’t believe that your deep compassion for others is a mere accident, do you?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Justice</b>: As Time can attest, I’ve endured and overcome many injustices. My compassion comes from having learned how much we needlessly suffer at the hands of Entropy and Fortune.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Wisdom</b>: That is true - much suffering is unnecessary. However, Entropy is not the figure of evil you imagine, and one can learn to see the duality of Fortune. But as you said, you’ve come to understand. That is, you’ve come to possess knowledge you previously did not have - knowledge that solved your problems.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Justice</b>: Evidently, but what is your point?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Wisdom</b>: It is that Entropy and Fortune are not the purveyors of evil you claim, but instead the purveyors of problems. Suffering exists not from intentioned evil but rather insufficient knowledge. Did you yourself not suffer until you possessed the knowledge that you no longer needed to suffer?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Justice</b>: I suppose that is true. But then what is knowledge?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Wisdom</b>: Knowledge is simply information that solves problems.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Justice</b>: Surely you’ve noticed that solutions to some problems just lead to more problems?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Wisdom</b>: Not just some - all problems. There is no foreseeable limit to knowledge because one can always know more. With greater considerations problems naturally arise. Problems are inevitable.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Justice</b>:  Will this continue forever?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Time</b>: Yes.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Justice</b>: Right. But you are saying we cannot help the Earthings. Do they need to make their own mistakes?  Why not help them, just as you’ve helped me understand this?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Wisdom</b>: I never told you anything you didn’t already know. Again, suffering is only the belief that your problems are insoluble. In such a circumstance it would be permissible to help them, but the custodians of Earth do not believe this. And to take away their greatest lessons to render them helpless in the face of future problems? That is unnecessary suffering.
</p> 
<p>
  <b>Justice</b>: And so they will be fine on their own?
</p>
<p>
  <b>Wisdom</b>: With their commitment to science and reason they know everything they need to know, but only Time can tell for sure.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Time</b>: As true for you as it is for them.
